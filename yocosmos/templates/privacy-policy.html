            Privacy Policy
        </p>
        <p>
            This privacy policy describes how yocosmos.com uses and protects any information that you give us. We are
            committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you provide us with personal information through
            yocosmos.com, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Website Visitors
        </p>
        <p>
            Like most website operators, yocosmos.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
            web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. yocosmos.com's purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how yocosmos.com's visitors use its website. From time to
            time, yocosmos.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
            a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yocosmos.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses. Yocosmos.com does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose
            such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
            information, as described below.

        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain visitors to yocosmos.com choose to interact with yocosmos.com in ways that require yocosmos.com to
            gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that yocosmos.com gathers
            depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a
            username and email address.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each case, yocosmos.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill
            the purpose of the visitor's interaction with yocosmos.com. yocosmos.com does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
            personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
            website-related activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the information that is collected on yocosmos.com will be handled in accordance with GDPR
            legislation.

        </p>
        <p>
            Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
        </p>
        <p>
            Yocosmos.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
            those of project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
            that information in order to process it on yocosmos.com's behalf or to provide services available through
            yocosmos.com, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors
            and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using yocosmos.com, you consent
            to the transfer of such information to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            yocosmos.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
            to anyone. Other than to project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as
            described above, yocosmos.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only when required to do so by law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or
            when yocosmos.com believes in good disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
            yocosmos.com, third parties, or the public at large.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a registered user of a yocosmos.com website and have supplied your email address, yocosmos.com
            may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
            up to date with what's going on with yocosmos.com and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate
            this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
            the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
            users. yocosmos.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
            alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use of personal information
        </p>
        <p>
            We will not sell or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are
            required by law to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            We would like to send you email marketing communication which may be of interest to you from time to time.
            If you have consented to marketing, you may opt out later.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. If you no longer wish to
            be contacted for marketing purposes, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

        </p>
        <p>
            We rely on one or more of the following processing conditions:

            Retention of personal information
        </p>
        <p>
            We will retain your personal information on our systems only for as long as we need to, for the success of
            CS27 and the programs that support yocosmos.com. We keep contact information (such as mailing list
            information) until a user unsubscribes or requests that we delete that information from our live systems. If

            may honor your request.
        </p>
        <p>
            When deletion is requested or otherwise required, we will anonymise the data of data subjects and/or remove
            their information from publicly accessible sites if the deletion of data would break essential systems or
            damage the logs or records necessary to the operation, development, or archival records of CS27.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to request deletion of your account and associated data, please contact support.
        </p>

                which we use such personal information (for information on deletion from archives, see the “Retention of

            <li>object to our processing of your personal information; and/or withdraw your consent to our processing of
                your personal information (to the extent such processing is based on consent and consent is the only
